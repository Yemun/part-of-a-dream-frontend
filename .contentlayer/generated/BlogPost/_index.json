Figma is a tool that allows designers to collaborate on design work in a web browser. Similar to how multiple people can simultaneously edit a document in Google Docs, Figma facilitates real-time collaboration among designers.\n\nHowever, at this conference, Figma announced a remarkable transformation. With this announcement, Figma is evolving from a design tool into a platform for creating **functioning products**.\n\n## How is software created?\n\nBefore we dive into the main topic, do you know how software is created?\n\n1. The **planner** decides “what to create.”\n2. A **designer** draws “how it will look.”\n3. A **developer** makes it “actually work.”\n\nEach stage requires experts, and coordinating and communicating with each other takes a lot of time. It's similar to architecture, where the person who draws the blueprints and the person who builds the structure are different individuals. However, with Figma, one person can now handle the entire process.\n\n## Four tools that change the way we work!\n\n![Figma co-founder Dylan Field introduces Figma's new product | cover](/images/figma-config-2025-day-2.jpg)\n\n### 1. Figma Site: Create a website with a single click\n\nUntil now, designers created beautiful visuals, which developers then translated into code. It was like looking at architectural blueprints and building an actual building. This process made it difficult to fully realize the designer's intent and took a lot of time.\n\nNow, designers can transform their Figma designs into live websites with a single click. A URL is generated that anyone can visit, click on, and use to access the real website.\n\nFor example, what if a café owner wants to create a website? In the past, they would have to hire a designer for the design, a developer for the creation, and rent a server from a hosting company. Now, they can design directly in Figma and publish immediately with **one click**.\n\n### 2. Figma Make: AI-assisted interaction\n\n**Figma Make** is even more impressive.\n\nIf you say, \"Create a rotating 3D globe,\" the AI will actually create one. Saying, \"Make the text appear gradually as you scroll,\" automatically adds that effect.\n\nIn the past, creating such effects required knowledge of JavaScript, a programming language. Now, though, you can just describe what you want in everyday language. It's like asking a colleague to complete a task—you can simply request it from the AI.\n\n### 3. Figma Draw: Professional-grade illustration\n\n**Figma Draw** integrates professional illustration tool functionality, like that of Adobe Illustrator, into Figma. Now, you can create logos or draw complex illustrations. A wide range of features have also been integrated into Figma Design, including:\n\n- Repeater to repeatedly place specific objects\n- Text on a Path, which provides text that flows along curves\n- Various features, such as Pattern Fill, Variable Width Stroke, and Texture Effect.\n\n### 4. Figma Buzz: Marketing Automation\n\n**Figma Buzz** automates repetitive design production tasks. For example, do you need to create 100 product banners? Enter the product names and prices into an Excel file, and 100 banners will be generated automatically.\n\n## Why is this revolutionary?\n\nConsider MVP (minimum viable product) development in the pre-AI era. At least four people were required:\n\n- Planner: Defines requirements and sets priorities.\n- Designer: UI/UX and visual design\n- Front-end developer: Implement the user interface\n- Backend developer: Build the server and database\n\nAlthough each role has its own area of expertise, communication costs increase exponentially. Meetings, documentation, feedback, and revisions are all necessary. In this process, the original idea becomes diluted and the production time increases.\n\n![Chad Bergman creating a carousel feature with Figma Make | cover](/images/figma-config-2025-chad-bergman.jpg)\n\nBut let's try using Figma's new tools. **Now one person can:**\n\n1. Design screens in Figma\n2. Add interactions with Make\n3. Deploy to Site to get real user feedback\n\nThis isn't just about efficiency. It dramatically shortens the distance from idea to execution, enabling more experimentation and significantly reducing the cost of failure.\n\n## Changes on the ground as described by Korean designers in Silicon Valley\n\n![Korean design group in California, Bay Area K Group meeting | cover](/images/bay-area-k-group.jpg)\n\nThe stories of Korean designers in Silicon Valley demonstrate that these changes are already occurring.\n\n> The meaning of prototyping has completely changed. In the past, it was about showing “this is the feel,” but now it's about showing “this is how it works.” Figma Make is the most important product that makes this possible. — Jason Kim, Product Designer at Figma\n\n> Every designer must become a SUPER IC (Individual Contributor). They must become product creators, not just screen designers. — Kyo Kim, Director of Product Design at GlossGenius\n\nAdditionally, engineers were demanding more from product prototypes.\n\n> I now use AI to create full product prototypes. These are not just click dummies; they connect to real data and track user behavior. I create a prototype based on a two-month-ahead roadmap and validate it through user testing. This allows me to assess the product's potential for success before development begins in earnest. — David Lee, AI UX Engineer at Google\n\n## What this means for us\n\nIn the future, the distinction between \"I'm a designer\" and \"I'm a developer\" will become blurred. Instead, the identity of \"I'm the person who creates the OOO product\" will become more important. The term \"maker\" is already becoming familiar in the software industry.\n\nAs technical barriers lower, anyone with an idea can create a service. For example, a restaurant owner could build their own reservation system, and a teacher could create an educational app.\n\nHowever, no matter how advanced the tools become, understanding what users truly want will always be a human task. Only products that solve real user problems will survive in the coming era.\n\n## Conclusion: The Beginning of a New Era\n\nFigma Config 2025 was more than just a product launch event. It showcased how the way we create software is changing. Figma began in 2016 with the vision of \"enabling designers to work together,\" and is now moving toward the larger vision of \"enabling anyone to create products.\"\n\nThe changes this will bring are just beginning. Imagine if you could bring your ideas to life immediately. What would you create?\n\n![ | cover](/images/figma-config-2025-day-3.jpg)\n",

      "raw": "\n![샌프란시스코의 나른한 날씨 속 Moscow Center | cover](/images/figma-config-2025-day-1.jpg)\n\n제품 디자이너의 축제, 전 세계에서 8,500명이 모인 Figma Config 컨퍼런스에 다녀왔습니다. Figma는 디자이너들이 웹 브라우저에서 함께 디자인 작업을 할 수 있게 해주는 도구인데요. 마치 구글 독스에서 여러 사람이 동시에 문서를 편집하듯이, 디자이너들의 실시간 협업을 도와주는 제품입니다.\n\n그런데 이번 컨퍼런스에서 Figma는 놀라운 변신을 선언했습니다. 이번 발표를 통해 Figma는 더 이상 디자인만 하는 도구가 아니라, **실제 작동하는 제품을 만드는 플랫폼**으로 나아가려고 해요.\n\n## 소프트웨어는 어떻게 만들어질까?\n\n본격적인 이야기에 앞서, 혹시 소프트웨어를 어떻게 만드는지 알고 계신가요?\n\n1. **기획자**가 \"무엇을 만들까?\"를 정합니다\n2. **디자이너**가 \"어떻게 보일까?\"를 그립니다\n3. **개발자**가 \"실제로 작동하게\" 만듭니다\n\n각 단계마다 전문가가 필요하고, 서로 간의 소통과 조율에 많은 시간이 걸립니다. 마치 건축에서 설계도를 그리는 사람과 실제로 짓는 사람이 다른 것처럼요. 그런데 Figma를 사용하면 이제 모든 과정을 한 사람이 전담할 수 있습니다.\n\n## 네 가지 도구로 바뀌는 일하는 방식\n\n![Figma의 Co-founder, Dylan Field가 Figma의 새로운 제품을 소개하고 있다 | cover](/images/figma-config-2025-day-2.jpg)\n\n### 1. Figma Site: 클릭 한 번으로 웹사이트 만들기\n\n지금까지는 디자이너가 예쁜 그림을 그리면, 개발자가 그것을 보고 코드로 다시 만들어야 했습니다. 마치 건축 도면을 보고 실제 건물을 짓는 것처럼요. 이 과정에서 디자이너의 의도가 100% 구현되기 어렵고, 시간도 오래 걸렸습니다.\n\n그런데 이제는 디자이너가 Figma에서 만든 디자인을 버튼 하나만 누르면 실제 웹사이트가 됩니다. 주소(URL)가 생기고, 누구나 들어가서 클릭하고 사용할 수 있는 진짜 웹사이트가 되는 거죠.\n\n예를 들어, 카페 사장님이 웹사이트를 만들고 싶다면? 예전에는 디자이너에게 디자인을 의뢰하고, 개발자에게 제작을 의뢰하고, 호스팅 업체에 서버를 임대해야 했습니다. 이제는 Figma에서 직접 디자인하고 \"배포하기\" 버튼 한 번에 바로 공개할 수 있습니다.\n\n### 2. Figma Make: AI가 도와주는 인터랙션\n\n**Figma Make**는 더 놀랍습니다.\n\n\"회전하는 3D 지구본을 만들어줘\"라고 말하면, AI가 실제로 돌아가는 지구본을 만들어줍니다. \"스크롤하면 글자가 서서히 나타나게 해줘\"라고 하면, 그런 효과가 자동으로 추가됩니다.\n\n이전에는 이런 효과를 만들려면 JavaScript라는 프로그래밍 언어를 알아야 했습니다. 하지만 이제는 일상적인 언어로 원하는 것을 설명하기만 하면 됩니다. 마치 동료에게 일을 전달하듯이 AI에게 요청하면 되는 거죠.\n\n### 3. Figma Draw: 전문가급 일러스트레이션\n\n**Figma Draw**는 Adobe Illustrator 같은 전문 일러스트 도구의 기능을 Figma 안에 통합했습니다. 로고를 만들거나, 복잡한 일러스트를 그리는 것이 가능해졌습니다. 그 외 아래와 같은 정말 많은 기능이 Figma Design에 통합되었습니다.\n\n- Repeater로 특정 오브젝트를 반복적으로 배치\n- Text on a path로 굴곡 위로 흐르는 텍스트 제공\n- Pattern Fill, Variable Width Stroke, Texture Effect 등 다양한 기능 등\n\n### 4. Figma Buzz: 마케팅의 자동화\n\n**Figma Buzz**는 반복적인 디자인 생산 작업을 자동화합니다. 예를 들어 100개의 제품 배너를 만들어야 한다면? 엑셀 파일에 제품명과 가격을 넣으면 자동으로 100개의 배너가 생성됩니다.\n\n## 왜 이것이 혁명적인가?\n\nAI 시대 이전의 MVP(Minimum Viable Product) 개발을 생각해봅시다. 최소한 네 명이 필요합니다:\n\n- 기획자: 요구사항 정의와 우선순위 결정\n- 디자이너: UI/UX 설계와 비주얼 디자인\n- 프론트엔드 개발자: 사용자 인터페이스 구현\n- 백엔드 개발자: 서버와 데이터베이스 구축\n\n각자의 전문성은 분명하지만, 커뮤니케이션 비용은 기하급수적으로 증가합니다. 회의, 문서화, 피드백, 수정... 이 과정에서 원래의 아이디어는 희석되고, 제작 시간은 길어져요.\n\n![회전목마 기능을 Figma Make로 제작하고 있는 Chad Bergman | cover](/images/figma-config-2025-chad-bergman.jpg)\n\n하지만 Figma의 새로운 도구들을 이용해봅시다. **이제 한 사람이:**\n\n1. Figma에서 화면을 디자인하고\n2. Make로 인터랙션을 추가하고\n3. Site로 배포하여 실제 사용자 피드백을 받을 수 있습니다\n\n이것은 단순히 효율성의 문제가 아닙니다. 아이디어에서 실행까지의 거리가 극적으로 단축되면서, 더 많은 실험이 가능지고, 실패에 따른 비용도 아주 많이 낮아집니다.\n\n## 실리콘밸리 한국 디자이너들이 말하는 현장의 변화\n\n![캘리포니아의 한인 디자인 그룹, Bay Area K Group 모임 | cover](/images/bay-area-k-group.jpg)\n\n실리콘밸리의 한국 디자이너분들의 이야기는 이런 변화가 이미 현장에서 일어나고 있음을 보여주고 있어요.\n\n> 프로토타입의 의미가 완전히 바뀌었어요. 예전에는 '이런 느낌입니다'를 보여주는 수준이었다면, 이제는 '이렇게 작동합니다'를 보여줄 수 있습니다. Figma Make는 이를 가능케 하는 가장 중요한 제품입니다. Jason Kim, Product Designer in Figma\n\n> 모든 디자이너가 SUPER IC(Individual Contributor)가 되어야 합니다. 단순히 화면을 설계하는 사람이 아니라, 제품을 만드는 사람이 되어야 해요. Kyo Kim, Director of Product Designer in GlossGenius\n\n추가로, 엔지니어 직군은 제품 프로토타입에 더 많은 것을 요구하고 있었습니다.\n\n> 저는 이제 AI를 활용해 풀 프로덕트 프로토타입을 만듭니다. 단순한 클릭 더미가 아니라, 실제 데이터를 연동하고 사용자 행동을 추적하는 수준까지요. 2개월 앞선 로드맵을 프로토타입으로 만들어두고, 사용자 테스트를 통해 검증합니다. 실제 개발에 들어가기 전에 이미 제품의 성공 가능성을 알 수 있는 거죠. David Lee, AI UX Engineer in Google\n\n## 이것이 우리에게 의미하는 것\n\n앞으로는 '나는 디자이너야', '나는 개발자야'라는 구분이 희미해질 것입니다. 대신 '나는 OOO 제품을 만드는 사람이야'라는 정체성이 중요해지겠죠. 이미 소프트웨어 업계에서는 Maker라는 단어가 익숙해지고 있습니다.\n\n기술적 장벽이 낮아지면서, 아이디어만 있다면 누구나 서비스를 만들어볼 수 있게 됩니다. 음식점 사장님이 직접 예약 시스템을 만들 수도 있고, 선생님이 교육 앱을 만들 수도 있습니다.\n\n하지만, 도구가 아무리 발전해도 사용자가 진짜 원하는 것이 무엇인지 이해하는 것은 여전히 사람의 몫입니다. 사용자의 진짜 문제를 해결하는 제품만이 살아남는 시대가 다가오고 있습니다.\n\n## 마무리: 새로운 시대의 시작\n\nFigma Config 2025는 단순한 제품 발표회가 아니었습니다. 소프트웨어를 만드는 방식 자체가 바뀌고 있음을 보여준 자리였습니다. 이제 2016년 '디자이너들이 함께 일할 수 있게 하자'는 비전으로 시작한 Figma가, **이제는 누구나 제품을 만들 수 있게 하자**는 더 큰 비전을 향해 나아가고 있습니다.\n\n이것이 가져올 변화는 이제 막 시작되었습니다. 여러분도 한번 상상해보세요. 만약 아이디어를 바로 실현할 수 있다면, 무엇을 만들고 싶으신가요?\n\n![ | cover](/images/figma-config-2025-day-3.jpg)\n",

      "raw": "\nIf you are a designer, then you probably drink coffee. Many of you probably buy an Americano on your way to work. I am one of those people.\n\nMy coffee journey began 15 years ago when I started college, and it continues to this day. **I would like to talk about how I became interested in coffee and how I enjoy it now.**\n\n## It all started with a coffee only 20 cents.\n\nI started drinking Americanos after entering university. The school co-op store sold meals and coffee at affordable prices. Starting in my second year, when my major courses began in earnest, I couldn't function in the morning without coffee.\n\nI stayed up almost every night working on major assignments, and the drinking sessions at the beginning and end of the semester naturally drew me to coffee shops. When I started to feel tired, I’d go out and buy coffee from a place nearby.\n\nAt the time, I thought all coffee tasted the same. Places like Starbucks were too expensive for students, so I never considered going there.\n\n## After becoming a working adult, Starbucks became a dream.\n\nHowever, after getting a job, **I too felt fulfilled when I arrived at the office with a Starbucks coffee.** Although Starbucks was still expensive, the KB National Bank FINETECH card offered the best discounts at that time.\n\n![The FINETECH card was great, but such cards are rare now.](/images/kb-finetech-card.png)\n\nIf you spent at least 300,000 won, you could enjoy Starbucks coffee at a 50% discount, up to 20,000 won per month. I remember buying an Americano for around 4,000 won every week and taking the elevator.\n\n### I developed a taste for it.\n\nI developed a **taste** for Americano after drinking it for 15 years. However, I still didn't have much money, so buying expensive coffee wasn't an option.\n\nAround that time, specialty coffee shops like **Fritz, Felt, and Momos** were starting to pop up in Korea, offering high-quality beans.

      "raw": "\nLast October, I met the love of my life and got married. At the same time, I was faced with practical issues that I hadn't thought about during our courtship, one of which was **household finances**.\n\nNine years ago, I got my first job, and I moved out the following year. From then on, I began to realize where my money was going and how much I was spending. Fixed expenses like electricity, gas, and internet bills were adding up, so I couldn’t ignore them anymore.\n\n### In college, my household budget consisted of my debit card statements.\n\nCategories like meals, coffee, and school supplies were simple, so debit card statements were enough. However, as my spending increased and became more complex, it became difficult to categorize each expense. When hanging out with friends for dinner and drinks, is that **food expenses** or **drink expenses**?\n\nThat’s when I started using the service **Bank Salad**.\n\n![Bank Salad helped me create my household budget back then. It's now famous for its genetic testing service.](/images/screenshot_banksalad.png)\n\nThanks to Bank Salad, which automatically categorizes my credit card transactions, managing my expenses became easier. I could also set and check budgets.\n\n### Then one day, the Toss Check Card appeared\n\n![My main card, the Toss Check Card](/images/toss-checkcard.png)\n\nI temporarily stopped using Bank Salad after three years because of the Toss Check Card. At the time, there were no performance conditions or annual fees, and you received 300 won in cash back for each payment. You could even eat a Big Mac for less than 5,000 won! However, one problem arose.\n\n> The transactions made with Toss were not visible in Bank Salad.\n\nToss provided a separate \"Spending\" screen within its app with a convenient structure for organizing cashback details. At the time, however, Bank Salad had technical limitations when it came to scraping data from other card companies, and Toss did not share information externally. I had no choice but to move my household budget to Toss. However, there was one thing I overlooked.\n\nThe Toss Consumption tab did not have the \"Download as File\" feature that Bank Salad had. I needed this feature because I organize my household budget in Excel every year. I searched through various menus but could not find a way to extract the entire consumption history. My complacent belief that \"it must be possible\" was the problem.\n\n### So I eventually settled on “Easy Ledger”\n\n![The app that takes household budgets seriously, Easy Ledger](/images/screenshot_easy-ledger.png)\n\nThis service is simple. **Just copy the text message from the card company and paste it into the app,** and it automatically assigns a name. No manual work is needed for cashback or item classification. You can even automate this process using the iPhone’s shortcut feature.\n\n## And after marriage, a new category emerged: “Wife's spending.”\n\nThis transaction history cannot be accessed via MyData or credit card texts. The biggest issue is that even if you receive the information, you can never know why the spending occurred unless you ask directly. If I were to ask my wife, “Why did you buy that?” every time she made a purchase… I might be single again by now. Repeated questions are off-limits with my wife. So we made a deal.\n\n> **Investments** are handled by my wife, and **spending management** is handled by me.\n\nMy wife bought NVIDIA at the bottom during the pandemic, while I bought a local apartment at the peak and ended up with a 10% loss. It was a natural decision.\n\n### Starting the wife's household budget book\n\nShe rotates between five banks and four credit cards to maximize benefits. I downloaded transaction histories and statements from each financial institution’s website and compiled data from nine institutions into Excel. There were 385 items in total.\n\nCategorizing each item into the 11 major categories and 42 subcategories I created was overwhelming.\nJust as I was wondering, \"Why am I doing this?\" , I encountered Claude.\n\n### I entrusted my household budget to AI\n\nSince my company has been automating many tasks recently, I naturally tried writing a prompt for Claude. I remembered handling data with Python in college, so writing the command wasn’t difficult.\n\n![Code generated from “Organize the consumption records according to my classification criteria file.”](/images/screenshot_vsc-consumption.png)\n\nThe results were astonishing. My Python screen displayed 220 lines of code containing over 500 keyword-matching tables organized in object form.\n\nThanks to Claude, I no longer have to ask my wife about daily payment details. Now, I have a complete household budget that allows me to view income and expenses at a glance on a quarterly basis.\n\nFinally, I’ll share the Python code written by Claude. I hope it brings peace to many households.\n\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport json\nimport re\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef load_classification_rules():\n    \"\"\"분류기준.json 파일을 로드합니다.\"\"\"\n    with open('분류기준.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        return json.load(f)\n\ndef classify_transaction(merchant, business_type, rules):\n    \"\"\"거래 내용을 분석하여 분류와 소분류를 결정합니다.\"\"\"\n    #
