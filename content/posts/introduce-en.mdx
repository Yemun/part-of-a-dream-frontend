Hello! My name is Yemun, and I am a product designer with nine years of experience.

Fifteen years ago, I was a teenager who loved to draw. Now, I am a writer who types more than I paint.
Even someone like me, who knows little about development, can now explore the rich world of the web.
I’ve been collecting my thoughts in a notebook, and now I’d like to share them with others, hoping they might be helpful.

My body may be lazy, but I’ll do my best to write diligently.

:-)
