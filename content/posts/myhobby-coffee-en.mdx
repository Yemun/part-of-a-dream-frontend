If you are a designer, then you probably drink coffee. Many of you probably buy an Americano on your way to work. I am one of those people.

My coffee journey began 15 years ago when I started college, and it continues to this day. **I would like to talk about how I became interested in coffee and how I enjoy it now.**

## It all started with a coffee only 20 cents.

I started drinking Americanos after entering university. The school co-op store sold meals and coffee at affordable prices. Starting in my second year, when my major courses began in earnest, I couldn't function in the morning without coffee.

I stayed up almost every night working on major assignments, and the drinking sessions at the beginning and end of the semester naturally drew me to coffee shops. When I started to feel tired, I’d go out and buy coffee from a place nearby.

At the time, I thought all coffee tasted the same. Places like Starbucks were too expensive for students, so I never considered going there.

## After becoming a working adult, Starbucks became a dream.

However, after getting a job, **I too felt fulfilled when I arrived at the office with a Starbucks coffee.** Although Starbucks was still expensive, the KB National Bank FINETECH card offered the best discounts at that time.

If you spent at least 300,000 won, you could enjoy Starbucks coffee at a 50% discount, up to 20,000 won per month. I remember buying an Americano for around 4,000 won every week and taking the elevator.

### I developed a taste for it.

I developed a **taste** for Americano after drinking it for 15 years. However, I still didn't have much money, so buying expensive coffee wasn't an option.

Around that time, specialty coffee shops like **Fritz, Felt, and Momos** were starting to pop up in Korea, offering high-quality beans. A cup of coffee there cost at least 5,000 won, but the blend beans they sold could be purchased for **16,000 won per 200 grams.**

## Cafe K Club with Colleagues

At my current company, I run a club called **CafeK** with my developer colleagues. At the beginning of each quarter, Terryjang Coffee delivers coffee to all club members, so I don't have to spend my own money on coffee.

However, the **expenses aren't decreasing**, and my wife is concerned about the gradually increasing number of personal brewing tools.

## In conclusion

If you love coffee, **try buying beans from your favorite café **and brewing drip coffee yourself; it’s a great way to enjoy delicious coffee anytime at an affordable price.

Looking back on my 15-year coffee journey, I've realized that coffee has evolved from merely a source of caffeine to a small joy in life. I look forward to discovering more delicious coffees in the future.
